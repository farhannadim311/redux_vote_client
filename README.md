# redux_vote_client
This project is a live voting application designed for events such as parties, conferences, meetings, and other gatherings. It allows participants to vote on various items (e.g., movies, songs, etc.) by presenting them in pairs. Participants can vote for their favorite, and through multiple rounds, a winner is determined.
